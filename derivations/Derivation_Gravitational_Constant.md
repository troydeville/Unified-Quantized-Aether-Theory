# Derivation of Gravitational Constant \( G \) in UQAT

## Overview
This file presents the derivation of the gravitational constant \( G \) within UQAT, where it is expressed as:

\[
G = \frac{\alpha_G}{\pi \Phi}
\]

### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Define Gravitational Coupling Constant (\( \alpha_G \))**: Establish \( \alpha_G \) in terms of UQAT constants.

2. **Spatial Parameter (\( \Phi \))**: Define \(\Phi\) and discuss its role as a spatial baseline in the Active Medium.

3. **Combine to Define \( G \)**:
   - Substitute \( \alpha_G \) and \( \Phi \) into the equation:

   \[
   G = \frac{\alpha_G}{\pi \Phi}
   \]

4. **Interpretation**: This expression implies that \( G \) is not an isolated constant but a property of the Active Medium that emerges from quantized spatial and gravitational relationships.
