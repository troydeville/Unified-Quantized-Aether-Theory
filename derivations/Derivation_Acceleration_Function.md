# Derivation of Acceleration Function in UQAT

## Overview
This document provides the derivation for the acceleration function within UQAT, given by:

\[
a_{\tau} = \frac{M_{\tau}^2}{R_{\tau} Q_{\tau}^2} \alpha_G
\]

where \( M_{\tau} \) represents effective mass, \( Q_{\tau} \) effective charge, and \( R_{\tau} \) the radius within the Active Medium.

### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Define Effective Mass (\( M_{\tau} \))**: The concept of mass in the Active Medium as it relates to gravitational interactions.
   - **Starting Point**: Mass within the Aether follows certain quantized properties (define or refer to any equations used to establish \( M_{\tau} \)).

2. **Effective Charge (\( Q_{\tau} \))**: Introduce effective charge in the medium.
   - Define the scaling factors or relationships that connect charge and gravitational properties.

3. **Combine Terms to Obtain Acceleration**: Substitute \( M_{\tau} \) and \( Q_{\tau} \) expressions and simplify.

   \[
   a_{\tau} = \frac{M_{\tau}^2}{R_{\tau} Q_{\tau}^2} \alpha_G
   \]

4. **Interpret the Result**: This expression reveals how gravitational acceleration in UQAT is inherently linked to mass and charge within the Aether.
