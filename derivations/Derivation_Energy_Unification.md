# A Unifying Expression Discovery

<!-- ## Overview
This work introduces a distinctive unifying equation within the **Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT)**, establishing a fundamental connection between **charge ($e$)**, **mass ($M$)**, and the **speed of light ($c$)**. Derived from the principles of an active, quantized medium, this equation suggests an intrinsic link between electromagnetic and gravitational interactions, bridging concepts that are traditionally treated as separate in conventional physics.

In conventional physics, charge and mass are typically treated as independent properties. This equation, however, suggests that both may arise from a unified, quantized medium. This novel perspective offers a pathway to a unified description of fundamental interactions, indicating that charge, mass, and the speed of light are interdependent properties that emerge within an active medium rather than isolated values. -->


$$\frac{eM}{\tau  (4 \pi  \text{$\epsilon $o})}=\frac{c^2 M}{e}$$
- $M$: mass in the aether
- $\tau:  \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_o c^2} \, \frac{\text{C}^2 \text{H}}{\text{m}}$


## Voltage or Charge per Capacitance Expression
For a mass $M$, the following expressions are equivalent in units of volts ($V$) or coulombs per farad ($C/F$), highlighting their interchangeability within this framework:
- $$\frac{M}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \times \frac{e}{\tau}$$

- $$
\frac{M c^2}{e}
$$

### Energy

An equation, proposed as a unifying expression in UQAT, is as follows:

$$
\frac{e^2 M}{\tau (4 \pi \epsilon_o)} = c^2 M
$$

This equation can also be rearranged to isolate the elementary charge ($e$):

$$
e = \sqrt{\frac{M c^2 4 \pi \epsilon_o \tau}{M}}
$$

Here, each term represents a fundamental constant or quantity:
- $e$: elementary charge
- $M$: mass (for any given particle or body in this model)
- $c$: speed of light in a vacuum
- $\epsilon_o$: permittivity of free space
- $\tau$: [quantized term representing the mass-charge ratio limit in the medium](../docs/Theory/Constants.md)

## Summary
This equation suggests that **charge, mass, and the speed of light are interconnected properties** within this active medium.
