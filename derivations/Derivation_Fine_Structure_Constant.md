# Derivation Involving the Fine Structure Constant \( \alpha \)

## Overview
This derivation explores the role of the fine structure constant, \(\alpha\), within UQAT, especially its interconnection with other constants in the Active Medium.

### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Define Fine Structure Constant (\( \alpha \))**
   - Start with the established value of the fine structure constant in quantum physics.

   \[
   \alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c}
   \]

2. **Adapt to UQAT Framework**
   - Substituting values within UQAT where \( e \), \(\epsilon_0\), and \(c\) might have specific interpretations or expressions.

3. **Derived Expression**
   - Express \(\alpha\) in terms of UQAT constants, if possible.

   \[
   \alpha = \text{(final expression here)}
   \]

4. **Implications**: Demonstrate how \(\alpha\) acts as a bridge between electromagnetic and gravitational properties.
