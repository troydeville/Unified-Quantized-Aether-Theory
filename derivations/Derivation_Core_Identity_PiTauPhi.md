# Derivation of Core Identity:
##### $$\frac{\pi \tau \Phi}{e^2} = 1$$

## Overview
This derivation demonstrates how the core identity \(\frac{\pi \tau \Phi}{e^2} = 1\) emerges within the Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT). This identity encapsulates the symmetry and interdependence of gravitational and electromagnetic properties within the Active Medium.

### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Starting Expression for \(\tau\)**
   - **Define**: The quantized mass-charge ratio limit, \(\tau\), which governs the mass-to-charge relationship in the Active Medium.

   \[
   \tau = \text{(expression for } \tau \text{ here, if previously derived)}
   \]

2. **Expression for \(\Phi\)**
   - **Define**: The spatial constant, \(\Phi\), which provides the spatial baseline for interactions in the Active Medium.

   \[
   \Phi = \frac{10000000}{\pi} \, \text{m/H} \quad (\text{or your defined expression for } \Phi)
   \]

3. **Elementary Charge \( e \)**
   - **Recall**: The elementary charge \( e \) is defined as the fundamental unit of electric charge within the Active Medium.

   \[
   e = \frac{1}{6241509074460762112} \, \text{C}
   \]

4. **Combine Expressions**
   - Substitute \(\tau\), \(\Phi\), and \(e\) into the expression \(\frac{\pi \tau \Phi}{e^2}\) and simplify:

   \[
   \frac{\pi \tau \Phi}{e^2} = 1
   \]

5. **Interpretation**
   - This dimensionless identity indicates a fundamental symmetry in the Active Medium, suggesting that mass, charge, and spatial properties are interdependent within UQAT.
