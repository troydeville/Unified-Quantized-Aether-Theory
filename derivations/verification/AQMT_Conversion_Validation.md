## Additional Relations for Verification and Testing

1. **Relationship Verification**:
   - Key relations are used to test the consistency of values and unify various constants. Examples include:
     \[
     \frac{\eta^2 2 \Gamma \Psi}{h e^2 \alpha \mu_0} = \frac{2 \pi}{\zeta^2}
     \]
     and
     \[
     \frac{\eta \zeta 2 \Gamma \Psi}{h} \cdot \frac{e^2 \alpha \mu_0}{\zeta \eta} = \frac{\alpha}{Z}
     \]
   - These expressions validate that charge, mass, and frequency align with UQAT’s unified relationships, supporting the framework’s precision.

2. **Active Force Relations**:
   - **Active Force Radius**: Defines the spatial extent for resonance between mass and charge within the aether.
     \[
     \text{ActiveForceRadius} = \frac{\mu_0 e^2}{4 \pi \cdot \text{ActiveForceMass} \cdot \eta}
     \]
   - **Mass Moment Velocity**:
     \[
     \zeta v = \frac{\Psi^2}{\sqrt{\frac{4 \Xi_f}{\Xi^2 \Psi^2} T}}
     \]
   - These values help determine the resonance coupling strength within the aether for energy applications.

3. **Planck and Omega Scales**:
   - **Omega Relation**:
     \[
     \text{ActiveForceOmegaRelation} = \frac{\text{ActiveForceRadius} \cdot \text{ActiveForceMassMomentEnergy}}{\text{ActiveForceMassMomentVelocity} \cdot \text{ActiveForceEnergy}} \approx \frac{625000}{4707 \pi} \, \text{F/m}
     \]
   - This relation reinforces the structured medium’s quantized properties, connecting energy, mass, and charge to a single cohesive model.
