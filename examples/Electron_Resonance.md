# Electron Properties and Medium Resonance in UQAT

This file explores foundational calculations showing how electron properties align with the quantized structure of UQAT’s active aether medium. These calculations connect constants like electron mass, Planck’s constant, and the fine structure constant to electron resonance within the medium, highlighting how the electron’s spatial scale and interactions reflect the structured nature of the aether.

### Key Calculations and Their Significance

1. **Electron Mass and Compton Wavelength**:
   - Calculating the **mass of the electron** yields the Compton wavelength:
     $$
     \lambda_c = \frac{h}{m_e c} \approx 2.42631 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m}
     $$
   - This wavelength represents a quantum spatial extent where the electron "couples" with the quantized aether, reinforcing the idea that fundamental particles resonate within the active medium.

2. **Expression Involving $\tau $, $\alpha $, and $m_e$**:
   - Another calculation:
     $$
     \frac{2 \tau}{\alpha \pi m_e} = 2.42631 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m}
     $$
   - This suggests a **unified spatial scale** for the electron, hinting that charge and mass emerge from the structured vacuum properties.

3. **Quantized Interaction Term $\tau / m_e $**:
   - Calculating:
     $$
     \frac{\tau}{m_e} = 2.81793 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}^2 \, \text{C}^2 / (\text{kg m F})
     $$
   - This term links time, charge, and spatial separation, showing that charge-mass interactions within the quantized medium are foundational to the electron’s behavior and properties.
