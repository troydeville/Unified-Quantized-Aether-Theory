# UQAT Applications Roadmap

## Purpose
The applications roadmap provides a timeline and development stages for realizing practical applications of UQAT.

## Roadmap

### 1. **Short-Term Goals (1-2 Years)**

- **Theoretical Simulation**: Conduct high-fidelity simulations to test resonance and field effects within a quantized medium.
- **Small-Scale Resonant Propulsion Prototypes**: Develop initial prototypes for reactionless thrust, aiming to validate resonance-based interactions with the aether.

### 2. **Medium-Term Goals (3-5 Years)**

- **Advanced Energy Storage Devices**: Apply UQATâ€™s principles to create high-density, stable energy storage solutions.
- **Field Manipulation Devices**: Design devices capable of manipulating inertial or gravitational effects through UQAT field interactions.

### 3. **Long-Term Goals (5+ Years)**

- **Unified Interaction Devices**: Develop devices that couple electromagnetic and gravitational fields, allowing for experimental control over force fields.
- **Scaled Resonant Propulsion**: Advance to larger-scale resonant propulsion systems for potential use in space exploration.
