# Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT)

**UQAT** redefines space as an active medium structured with quantized properties.

> $m$: The mass of a body.
$c$: The speed of light.
$e$: The elementary charge.
$\epsilon_o$: The permittivity of the medium.
$\tau$: [The distributed mass-charge space of the medium.](docs/Theory/Constants.md)
