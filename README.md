# Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT)

## Overview
The Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT) presents a reimagined model of the universe as a quantized, structured medium—an “aether” permeated by fundamental constants that govern mass, charge, gravity, and space itself. UQAT challenges the traditional view of space as a vacuum, instead proposing a medium with exact, inherent values that shape all interactions within it.

## Key Components of UQAT
* **Novel Constants**: UQAT introduces new constants defining frequency, spatial, and energy limits of this medium, describing physical constraints as inherent to the aether.
* **Redefined Physical Constants**: Traditional constants like Planck’s constant and the gravitational constant are reformulated in terms of UQAT, reflecting the universe’s quantized and structured nature.
* **Exact Values Framework**: All values are represented exactly, aligning with the principle that the universe has inherent precision, with no rounding or infinity.
* **Geometric Structure**: UQAT envisions the universe as a geometric construct, where space, mass, and energy behave according to the aether’s quantized nature.

## Theory Development
UQAT emerged through iterative exploration, leading to discoveries linking the mass-charge relationship, gravity, and spatial constraints. This theory represents space as an “active medium,” where every fundamental interaction is embedded within the quantized aether’s structure.
