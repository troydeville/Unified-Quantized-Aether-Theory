# Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT)

The **Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT)** redefines space as an **Active Medium** filled with quantized energy, aiming to unify **electromagnetism**, **gravity**, and **nuclear forces** through an interconnected framework of fundamental constants.

Inspired by concepts from Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity, UQAT suggests that space is an energy-filled, resonant medium, facilitating all interactions.

## Goals

### 1. **Theoretical Foundations**
   - Define UQAT constants and validate key relationships among mass, charge, and space within the medium.
   - Reformulate traditional constants (e.g., \( G \), \( h \), \( c \)) within UQAT’s quantized structure.
   - Validate identities (e.g., \( \frac{e^2 \mu_o}{4 \pi \tau} = 1 \)) that unify UQAT's core principles.

### 2. **Geometric and Resonance Properties**
   - Establish the medium’s geometry and natural resonance frequencies.
   - Define scales for spatial and temporal resonance and their roles in field interactions.

### 3. **Experimental and Practical Goals**
   - Prototype a resonance-based propulsion system within the Active Medium.
   - Explore high-density energy storage and inertial manipulation methods based on UQAT.

### 4. **Theory Expansion and Validation**
   - Derive additional constants within UQAT and compare with empirical data.
   - Document findings to support the open-source UQAT framework.
