# Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT)

**UQAT** redefines space as an active medium structured with quantized properties.

Inspired by concepts from Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity, UQAT suggests that space is an energy-filled, resonant medium, facilitating all interactions.

$$\text{E}(m) = mc^2 = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_o}  \frac{m}{\tau}$$

> $m$: The mass of a body.
$c$: The speed of light.
$e$: The elementary charge.
$\epsilon_o$: The permittivity of the medium.
$\tau$: [The distributed mass-charge space of the medium.](docs/Theory/Core_Constants.md)
