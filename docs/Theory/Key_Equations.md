# Key Equations

This file provides step-by-step derivations of key equations and relationships within the Unified Quantized Aether Theory.

## 1. Derivation of the Gravitational Constant (G)

- **Equation**: \( G = \frac{\alpha_G}{\pi \Phi} \)
- **Derivation**:
  - Starting from UQAT's gravitational coupling constant, \( \alpha_G \), and permeability constant \( \Phi \).
  - Gravitational force emerges from a quantized interaction of the aether, and thus \( G \) is derived as a function of \( \alpha_G \) and \( \Phi \).

## 2. Derivation of the Speed of Light (c)

- **Equation**: \( c = e \sqrt{\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \tau}} \)
- **Derivation**:
  - Using UQAT’s expressions for \( e \), \( \epsilon_0 \), and \( \tau \), the speed of light \( c \) is derived as a property of the medium’s quantized charge and permittivity.

## 3. Acceleration Function

- **Equation**: \( a_{\tau} = \frac{M_{\tau}^2}{R_{\tau} Q_{\tau}^2} \alpha_G \)
- **Derivation**:
  - Based on UQAT’s quantized mass and charge ratios, this equation describes acceleration as a function of mass, charge, and distance, mediated by the gravitational coupling constant \( \alpha_G \).
