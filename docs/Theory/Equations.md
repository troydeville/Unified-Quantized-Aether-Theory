# Key Equations

This file provides step-by-step derivations of key equations and relationships within the Unified Quantized Aether Theory.

## Derivation of the Gravitational Constant (G)

- **Equation**: \( G = \frac{\alpha_G}{\pi \Phi} \)
- **Derivation**:
  - Starting from UQAT's gravitational coupling constant, \( \alpha_G \), and permeability constant \( \Phi \).
  - Gravitational force emerges from a quantized interaction of the aether, and thus \( G \) is derived as a function of \( \alpha_G \) and \( \Phi \).

## Derivation of the Speed of Light (c)

- **Equation**: \( c = e \sqrt{\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \tau}} \)
- **Derivation**:
  - Using UQAT’s expressions for \( e \), \( \epsilon_0 \), and \( \tau \), the speed of light \( c \) is derived as a property of the medium’s quantized charge and permittivity.

## Acceleration Function

- **Equation**: \( a_{\tau}(M, R, Q) = \frac{M^2}{R Q^2} \alpha_G \)
- **Derivation**:
  - Based on UQAT’s quantized mass and charge ratios, this equation describes acceleration as a function of mass, charge, and distance, mediated by the gravitational coupling constant \( \alpha_G \).

## Coulombs per Farad or Voltage Equation
For a mass, M, the following can be expressed having units volts, $V$, or coulombs per farad, ${C}/{F}$.
1. $$
\frac{M}{4 \pi  \epsilon_o} \times \frac{e}{\tau}
$$

2. $$
\frac{M c^2}{\text{e}}
$$

## Energy
$$
\frac{e^2 M}{\tau  \left(4 \pi  \epsilon _o\right)} = M c^2 
$$
