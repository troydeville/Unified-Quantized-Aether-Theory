# Theory Overview

---

## Introduction
**Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT)** redefines space as an active, quantized aether medium that fundamentally influences mass, charge, gravity, and interactions. UQAT offers a unified framework, replacing the classical vacuum with a structured medium.

## Fundamental Principles

1. **Quantized Aether**:
   - UQAT proposes that space is not empty but a structured medium with exact, intrinsic values, actively shaping all interactions.

2. **Reimagined Constants**:
   - Constants like the speed of light (\( c \)), Planck's constant (\( h \)), and the gravitational constant (\( G \)) are derived within UQAT, making them properties of the quantized medium.

3. **Geometry and Resonance**:
   - UQAT envisions a geometric structure within the aether, where resonance governs energy, mass, and charge interactions.

## Key Concepts and Equations

1. **Frequency Constant - \( \Psi \)**
   - \( \Psi = \frac{149896229}{\pi} \; \text{Hz} \)
   - Represents fundamental oscillation frequency of the aether, crucial for resonance-based applications.

2. **Spatial Constant - \( \Gamma \)**
   - \( \Gamma = 1 \; \text{m} \)
   - Defines a fundamental spatial unit influencing interactions at quantum scales.

3. **Permeability Constant - \( \Phi \)**
   - \( \Phi = \frac{10000000}{\pi} \, \text{m/H} \)
   - Governs magnetic field behavior in the aether, serving as a foundation for field interactions.

## Implications for Physics

- **Unification of Forces**: Resonant interactions within the aether suggest a pathway for unifying forces under a single framework.
- **No Vacuums, Only Structure**: UQAT reinterprets "empty" space as an active medium, embedding every particle and field interaction within a quantized structure.
