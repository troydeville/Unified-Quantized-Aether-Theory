# Derived Expressions in UQAT

This file documents key derived expressions in UQAT and their significance.

### Expression for Gravitational Constant (\( G \))
- **Formula**: \( G = \frac{\alpha_G}{\pi \Phi} \)
- **Interpretation**: This expression defines \( G \) as a function of gravitational coupling \(\alpha_G\) and spatial properties \(\Phi\) of the Active Medium.

### Fundamental Dimensionless Identity
- **Formula**: \( \frac{2 \pi^2 \alpha h}{c e^2 \mu_0} = 1 \)
- **Interpretation**: This identity shows an inherent symmetry among fundamental constants within UQAT, suggesting the interconnectedness of quantum and electromagnetic properties.


$\frac{\pi  \tau  \Phi }{e^2}=1$
