# Introduction

---

## Overview

The **Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT)** seeks to unify electromagnetism and gravity through a quantized, structured aether. UQAT redefines space as an active medium, where constants are precise, and forces emerge from inherent properties of this medium.

---

## Core Concepts

1. **Quantized Aether**: 
   - UQAT redefines the vacuum as an active, structured medium with exact, quantized values that influence all forces.

2. **Exact Constants**: 
   - Constants like \( c \), \( G \), and \( h \) emerge as properties of the medium, establishing fundamental scales for interactions.

3. **Resonance and Geometry**: 
   - The medium’s geometry governs resonance, linking energy, mass, and charge interactions. UQAT’s structured aether enables fields and particles to resonate with the fabric of space.
