# Gravitational Interpretations in UQAT

In UQAT, gravity is understood as an emergent property of the Aetherâ€™s structure, rather than an independent force. By expressing \( G \) in terms of Aether properties, the theory posits that gravitational effects arise from the inherent symmetry and resonance of the Active Medium.

This document provides interpretations of gravity within UQAT, including:
- The role of gravitational coupling constant (\( \alpha_G \))
- Implications for varying gravitational strength in extreme conditions.
