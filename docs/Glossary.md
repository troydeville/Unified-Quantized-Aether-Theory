# UQAT Glossary

This glossary explains key terms, symbols, and constants used in the Unified Quantized Aether Theory.

- **Aether**: The active, quantized medium proposed by UQAT, which permeates space and governs interactions.
  
- **\( \Psi \)**: Frequency constant of the aether, defining intrinsic oscillation and resonance characteristics; \( \Psi = \frac{149896229}{\pi} \, \text{Hz} \).

- **\( \Gamma \)**: Spatial constant, set to 1 meter, representing the fundamental spatial unit of the aether medium.

- **\( \Phi \)**: Permeability constant of the aether, defining its capacity to support magnetic fields; \( \Phi = \frac{10000000}{\pi} \, \text{m/H} \).

- **\( \alpha \)**: Fine-structure constant, which governs the strength of electromagnetic interactions.

- **\( \tau \)**: Quantized mass-charge ratio limit, a constant that influences the interaction scale of mass and charge in the aether.

- **\( c \)**: Speed of light in the aether, derived from UQAT’s properties as \( c = 299792458 \, \text{m/s} \).

- **\( \alpha_G \)**: Gravitational coupling constant, linking mass to the medium’s properties within UQAT.

- **Resonant Propulsion**: Hypothetical propulsion that leverages resonance with the quantized aether to achieve reactionless thrust.
