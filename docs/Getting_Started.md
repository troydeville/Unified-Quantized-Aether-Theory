## Overview of UQAT

**Unified Quantized Aether Theory (UQAT)** redefines our understanding of fundamental forces by introducing a structured, quantized aether. In this model, mass, charge, gravity, and space are interconnected through exact values derived from this active medium, challenging traditional concepts in physics.

### Key Concepts
- **Quantized Aether**: A structured medium permeating space, with quantized energy units that underlie all interactions.
- **Exact Constants**: UQAT relies on constants with no rounding, reflecting precise relationships within the aether.
- **Unified Framework**: The theory seeks to unify electromagnetism and gravity under one medium, redefining constants and forces in terms of a single framework.
