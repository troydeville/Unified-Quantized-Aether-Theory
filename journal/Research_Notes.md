# Research Notes on UQAT

This file contains ongoing research notes, observations, and hypotheses related to the development of UQAT.

### Recent Findings
- **Relationship for \( G \)**: Recently found that \( G = \frac{\alpha_G}{\pi \Phi} \), suggesting gravitational strength emerges from the Active Medium.
- **Fine Structure Constant**: Continued exploration of \(\alpha\)â€™s role as a bridge between forces in UQAT.

## Key Findings

- **Emergence of Gravity**: Gravity is modeled as an emergent effect based on Aether properties, rather than an isolated force.
- **Fine Structure Constant as a Bridge**: The fine structure constant $( \alpha )$ appears as a recurring element, linking various forces within the Active Medium.
- **Gravitational Constant Derivation**: $( G )$ is expressed in terms of gravitational coupling and spatial properties of the Aether.
