# Research Notes on UQAT

This file contains ongoing research notes, observations, and hypotheses related to the development of UQAT.

### Recent Findings
- **Relationship for \( G \)**: Recently found that \( G = \frac{\alpha_G}{\pi \Phi} \), suggesting gravitational strength emerges from the Active Medium.
- **Fine Structure Constant**: Continued exploration of \(\alpha\)â€™s role as a bridge between forces in UQAT.
